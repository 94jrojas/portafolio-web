Gods of the Eternal is a multiplayer game that I decided to develop with some friends (we were 3 people on the team). I was the programmer for this game. I did a lot of things with the experience I had gained in my previous years of making smaller projects in Unity. I coded the gameplay, networking, UI, audio, tools, and even a API server for purchasing In-game currency from a website using Stripe. I also was the UI designer.

In addition to using all my previous knowledge in the creation of the game I also learned a ton of new things. One of the main challenges was that Gods of the Eternal is a multiplayer game, with a dedicated server, so I had to learn how to make that work.

Implementing the real-time online status was also a challenge because I had to use other technologies alongside Unity, like NodeJS and SocketIO.

Gods of the Eternal was developed in a year and a half.

I made use of the following technologies and services for creating Gods of the Eternal:`,
